				<h2>What to do</h2>
				<p>Dunster is situated in the sweeping hills of the Exmoor National Park.  Dunster has a wealth of historic buildings, from the <a href="http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/dunster-castle" target="_blank">National Trust Dunster Castle</a> to the Old Yarn Market in the middle of the High Street.</p>  
				<p>There are also lots of beautiful <a href="http://www.dunsterestate.co.uk/things-to-see-do/activities/walking-trails/" target="_blank">walking trails</a> to help cure your hangover; we recommend the <a href="http://www.dunsterestate.co.uk/things-to-see-do/activities/walking-trails/conygar-wood-circuit/" target="_blank">walk to the top of Conygar Tower</a>, which is the folly you see from afar as you approach Dunster.</p>  
				<p>Dunster beach and <a href="http://westsomersetrailway.vticket.co.uk/article.php/21/dunster" target="_blank">train station</a> (served by steam trains) are walkable from the village and worth a visit.</p>
